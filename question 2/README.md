# Coding Test q2 

### [ Answer to Question No. 2 ]
This programme Implements the following piecewise recurrence relation in the 3 different ways.
Below is a quick documentation and thought process explaining the entire programme.

## How to compile and run the programme
    The programme was written in C language and developed using CodeBlocks IDE, source code can be found in the question2.c file.
    or
    Simply open the source code using a CodeBlock IDE and click on the Build and run button to execute and output results of the programme.

    ## Minimum System Requirements
    -Operating System: Windows 10 or 11 (Recommened)
    -Codeblocks IDE (version 20.03)

    ## Steps
    - Install codeblocks IDE
    - open the file question2.c using the IDE
    - click build and run (A console window will open and it'll print the output)
    - Done

##Introduction
    -This program implements the piecewise recurrence using looping, recursion and dynamic programming.


## Differences (advantages, disadvantages)
The dynamic programming approach is more efficient than the recursive approach as it uses an array to store the values of previously calculated F(n)
which reduces the number of function calls. However, it still takes up more memory and takes longer to run than the other solutions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues compiling or running the program, please refer to the error messages generated in the IDE terminal for assistance. Make sure that all required dependencies are installed and that the commands are being properly formatted from IDE.
